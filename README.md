# clone.js

Hi everyone who sees this,

I created this really fast during work, because we needed a function that was very fast at copying large dom elements within a container. 
Mainly input fields, but it was very slow using jquery for this. 

We needed something that was reasonably on the fly without any lag, so with some digging using my minor javascript skills I created this. 

# Features that need to be added

- Good readme
- Example file

# Things to improve:

- Better commenting, made this in 20 minutes
- Better explanation in the comments about the functions
